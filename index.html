    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Kae, a curious and motivated developer with a growing passion for clean code, creative problem-solving, and lifelong learning. 
      Whether it's front-end web apps or backend scripts, I love turning ideas into functional projects. 
      I'm currently focused on expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#, with a strong interest in open-source collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I enjoy digital art, music, and diving into the latest tech trends. 
      My GitHub portfolio is a reflection of both my learning progress and the things that inspire me to build. 
      Thanks for stopping by!
